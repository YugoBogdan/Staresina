This is supposed to be open source game-engine-ception. Currently it is a game maker library wanna be.

This is a text adventure, made in such manner that a person without knowledge in programming should be able to make a game.

Everything is done via json files. They contain story, soldier lists, other story encounters and cases, etc.

IT IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS OFC

but it would be kinda interesting if something universal would be made - a game maker built tool for making games of this specific genre (text adventures) easilly

I am, of course, just using it to make my own game... But it is interesting to have more benefit from the work, and to make something useful for everybody (or some other people at least).
